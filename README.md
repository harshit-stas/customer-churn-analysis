This project analyzes customer churn behavior using a real-world telecom dataset. The objective is to identify key churn indicators and suggest data-backed strategies for improving customer retention.

## 📊 Key Findings

- **Month-to-month contracts** have a **42.7% churn rate** — much higher than long-term contracts.
- **New customers** (0–6 months) show **over 53% churn**, suggesting onboarding issues.
- **Higher-paying users** (avg ₹74.44) leave more often — potential pricing/value mismatch.
- **Electronic check users** churn the most (45.3%) — manual billing may be inconvenient.
- Lack of **security/tech support** correlates with increased churn.

## 📌 Business Recommendations

1. Promote long-term contracts with perks and pricing benefits.
2. Improve new customer onboarding (welcome kits, support, NPS surveys).
3. Launch loyalty programs for high-value customers.
4. Encourage AutoPay enrollments via cashbacks and ease-of-use.
5. Bundle online security & support services to increase stickiness.
